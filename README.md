# 2016 US Bike Share Activity Snapshot

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used. 

Exploratory analysis is conducted on the bike-share data for three major cities in the US (New York City, Chicago and Washington, DC). System usage is compared between the cities as well as time of the week and between types of users.
